Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a Satellite Command System that simulates controlling a satellite in orbit. The satellite starts in a default
initial state and can accept a series of commands to change its orientation, solar panel status, and data collection.
Functional Requirements
1. Initialize the Satellite: Create a class or function that initializes the satellite's attributes to their initial state.
2. Rotate: Implement a command called 'rotate' that takes a direction parameter (North, South, East, West) and sets the satellite's
orientation accordingly.
Example: rotate(North) would set the orientation to "North".
3. Activate/Deactivate Solar Panels: Implement commands called 'activatePanels' and 'deactivatePanels' to control the solar panels'
status.
Example: activatePanels() would set the solar panels to "Active".
4. Collect Data: Implement a command called 'collectData' that increments the 'Data Collected' attribute by 10 units, but only if the solar
panels are "Active".
Example: collectData() would set the data collected to 10 if the solar panels are "Active".
Initial State
Your satellite begins with the following attributes:
Orientation: "North"
Solar Panels: "Inactive"
Data Collected: 0
Commands to be executed
The series of commands should be executed in a sequential manner over the initial state, altering the satellite's state accordingly. You could
execute them through function calls, or simulate a command-line interface where these commands can be entered.
For example:
rotate(South)
activatePanels()
collectData()
After these commands, the satellite's state would be:
Orientation: "South"
Solar Panels: "Active"
Data Collected: 10
